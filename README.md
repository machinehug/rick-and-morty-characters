#### What is this project?

This project includes a simple Rick and Morty character list with character details using this API: [https://rickandmortyapi.com/](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

You can also log into your Strapi account on the login page.

You can fill out a contact form, but the form doesn't actually send a message.

Both forms use Yup and Axios.

### Getting Started with Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
